## 🧠 Security Architecture Principles

This project is built with the following security principles:

### 🔐 Core Security Layers

- Input validation & sanitization  
- Authentication & authorization (JWT, OAuth – planned)  
- Secure API design (rate limiting, validation)  
- Encryption (data in transit & at rest)  
- Secure environment configuration (`.env` protection)  

---

## ⚙️ Infrastructure Security

- Isolated environments (dev / staging / production)  
- Dependency vulnerability scanning  
- Secure database access controls  
- Logging & monitoring for anomaly detection  

---

## 🧪 Testing & Auditing

We aim to implement:

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)  
- Dependency vulnerability scanning  
- Manual security reviews  
- AI-assisted anomaly detection (future OSAR module)  

---

## 🚫 Out-of-Scope (for now)

- Social engineering attacks  
- Physical access exploits  
- Third-party service vulnerabilities  

---

## ⚡ Future Security Enhancements (OSAR Vision)

- 🔑 JWT-based authentication system  
- 🧩 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- 🛡️ API Gateway security layer  
- 🤖 AI-driven threat detection  
- ⚛️ Quantum-resilient encryption (research phase)  

---

## 🏆 Security Commitment

We are committed to:

- Continuous improvement of system security  
- Following industry best practices  
- Building secure, scalable, and sovereign systems
